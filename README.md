- `Login` to our website by clicking the LOGIN button on the top right of the website on the navbar. It takes you to the login page, where you can login to your user account.
- Or if you are not a member, click on `Register` to goto the registration page to create a user account.
- You also have the option to sign in to our website using `Google Authentication`.
- After login or registration, you can see your Username and Profile Photo on the top right corner of the webpage on the navbar, along with the LOGOUT button.
- Take a tour of our `Upcoming Events` or `About Us` pages to get an idea of how we manage our events.
- The service details, upcoming events, and about us pages are private, so you can only access them after you login. If you are not logged in, it will redirect you to the login page, and after you signed in using your user details, you are then redirected to your desired page.
